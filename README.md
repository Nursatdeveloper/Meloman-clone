# Meloman-clone

My application uses ASP.NET Core 5 for backend, and JS/jQuery for frontend.
For database, I used PostgreSql which is hosted in Heroku platform.

I implemented only Books category, because other product types use the same functionality and take unnecessary memory in heroku's limited database.

Application has a number of functionalities:
1) Authentication and Authorization
  Cookie based authorization
  Claim based authorization
  Policy based authorization
